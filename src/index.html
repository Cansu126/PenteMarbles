            <div class="about-card">
                <h3 class="about-name1">Who We Are?</h3>
                <p class="brief2">We are artisans of the finest marble, born of the quarries and nurtured by the art of
                    creation. From the heart of our bustling polis, we serve as both merchants and sculptors, breathing
                    life into the sacred stone revered by gods and mortals alike.

                    With every chisel’s strike, we honor the traditions of our ancestors, shaping marble into forms that
                    capture the essence of beauty and the spirit of our time. Whether adorning a temple or a hero’s
                    monument, our work speaks of devotion, craftsmanship, and the enduring legacy of Hellenic artistry.
                </p>
            </div>


            <div class="about-card">
                <h3 class="about-name1">What We Do?</h3>
                <p class="brief2">We uncover the finest marbles from the sacred quarries of Paros and Naxos, selecting
                    each block with the care of a priest tending a temple. As traders, we offer the raw beauty of this
                    noble stone to architects, sculptors and builders seeking perfection in their creations.

                    However, our work does not end with trade. As artists, we carve marble ourselves, transforming it
                    into forms that honor gods, celebrate heroes, and preserve the stories of our times. From the
                    majestic columns of great temples to the folds of the elegant robes of a divine statue, we reveal
                    the soul of the stone.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-card">
                <h3 class="about-name1">Our Story</h3>
                <p class="brief2">Our story begins in the shadow of the sacred quarries, where the whispers of the Earth
                    call to those who listen. Born into a family of artisans, I learned to see the potential within
                    stone from an early age. My father taught me the art of choosing marble that would honor the gods,
                    and my mother instilled in me the patience to carve its form with reverence and care.

                    Over the years, my hands have become both merchant and sculptor. I have walked the sunlit paths of
                    Paros, selecting marble blocks that gleam with divine promise. Each piece I craft tells a story—of
                    gods descending to earth, of heroes immortalized in their triumphs, and of beauty that endures
                    beyond the fleeting lives of mortals.

                    This is more than a livelihood; it is a legacy. With every chisel’s strike, I honor the traditions
                    of my ancestors and offer my work to the gods and the people of our polis.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-card">
                <h3 class="about-name1">What Makes Us Unique?</h3>
                <p class="brief2">What sets us apart is not only our mastery of marble but also our devotion to its
                    transformation. Unlike others who merely trade in stone, we see marble as a living entity, waiting
                    to reveal its true form. As both merchants and sculptors, we possess the rare ability to recognize
                    the soul within the stone and bring it to life with our own hands.

                    Every block we select is chosen with the eye of an artist and the expertise of a craftsman. From the
                    pristine quarries of Naxos to the bustling agora of Athens, our marble is known not just for its
                    quality but for the stories it tells-stories of gods, heroes, and the eternal beauty of our world.

                    In our workshop, the line between trade and artistry dissolves. We do not simply provide marble; we
                    shape visions, honor the divine.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-card">
                <h3 class="about-name1">How Do We Work?</h3>
                <p class="brief2">Each stone begins as a gift from the earth, selected with reverence and purpose. From
                    the sacred quarries of Paros and Naxos, we extract marble with care, understanding that within each
                    block lies a story waiting to be unveiled.

                    In our workshop, the work begins with silence, allowing us to hear the whispers of the stone. With
                    chisels honed to precision and the wisdom of years, we sculpt not merely with our hands but with our
                    hearts and devotion. Each strike is measured, each curve a tribute to the gods, the heroes, and the
                    mortal world we inhabit.

                    We work not in haste but in harmony with the marble, unveiling its true essence. Whether crafting a
                    temple column to reach the heavens or a statue to honor a hero, our labor is imbued with the
                    timeless artistry of Hellenic tradition.
                    This is how we work-with respect for the stone, faith in the process. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-card">
                <h3 class="about-name1">Who Do We Serve?</h3>
                <p class="brief2">We serve those who seek the eternal grace of marble and the beauty it can embody.
                    Architects come to us, envisioning temples that reach toward the heavens, their columns and
                    pediments brought to life by our hands. Sculptors rely on us to provide marble worthy of their
                    craft, stone that will carry their visions of gods, heroes, and legends into eternity.

                    But we do not serve only the great and the powerful. We serve the dreams of all who wish to honor
                    the divine or commemorate the deeds of mortals. Whether for a grand altar in a sacred sanctuary or a
                    humble relief to mark a family’s devotion, we treat every commission with the reverence it deserves.

                    Our marble is for those who wish to build, to create, and to remember. It is for those who
                    understand that true beauty lies in what endures.</p>

                    accompanies the liveliness of the Agora! Attalos, the generous king of Pergamon, had this stoa built
                    as a gift to the Athenians. With its long columns and double-storey structure, it is both
                    eye-catching and functional. Doric columns on the lower floor and Ionic columns on the upper floor
                    represent elegance.

                    Here, tradesmen line up their shops, philosophers share their thoughts, and people rest in the
                    shade. As a place where commerce, art and conversation meet, the stoa reflects the spirit of the
                    city. The beauty of its stones under the sun attracts people; This place is a meeting point for
                    everyone.</p>

                <p class="gallery-text">Ah, the Palace of Knossos! A fascinating collection of buildings in the heart of
                    Crete, reflecting the splendor of Minoans. Kings lived here and ties were established with the gods.
                    Festivals were held in its large courtyards, and bulls danced in the frescoes painted on its walls.

                    The rooms inside the palace resemble a labyrinth; Every corridor hides a different secret. The
                    stories of the Minotaur also wander in the echoes of these stone walls. In their storehouses are
                    earthen jars of oil, wine, and grain; The palace is the center of both prosperity and order. As the
                    winds of Crete wander through its columns, Knossos is a salute to the creative power of man and the
                    magnificence of nature.</p>

                    place dedicated to the God Asclepius, celebrating the harmony of man with nature! The plays staged
                    here are not just entertainment, they are rituals that purify the souls. It is an engineering marvel
                    worthy of the gods, with its perfect acoustics where sounds echo from the stone rows and reach the
                    farthest corners.

                    Every summer, people come from surrounding cities; They find the meaning of life in songs, dances
                    and tragedies. When you look up from the middle steps, the view spanning the surrounding lush green
                    hills is breathtaking. The Theater of Epidaurus is not just a building, it is the place where the
                    heart of a community and the gods beats.</p>

                    the glory of Pergamon! This huge altar dedicated to Zeus rises into the sky above the city, as if it
                    builds a bridge between the gods and mortals. When you go up the stairs, you will be greeted by
                    fascinating reliefs. This detailed workmanship, which describes the Gigantomachy, that is, the war
                    of the gods with the giants, goes beyond the stone and keeps a legend alive.

                    Not only sacrifices are offered here, but the people of Pergamon express their devotion to the gods.
                    The prayers echoing in the ceremonies mix with the sky with the scent of incense. This altar is the
                    pride of our city and proof that we are blessed by the gods. May the gods protect us all and raise
                    Pergamon even higher!</p>

                    flowing with all its liveliness. The agora is not only a marketplace, but also a sacred place where
                    ideas collide, laws are debated, and gods are honored.

                    When the sun rises, merchants set up their stalls and display their various wares: olive oil
                    amphorae, fresh fish, soft fabrics and handcrafted products. In one corner, philosophers explain
                    wisdom to their students; Socrates' voice often echoes in the Agora.

                    Temples are places of worship dedicated to our gods. The temple of Hephaestus honors the god's
                    supreme talent for craftsmanship, and our devotion to Athena, the patroness of our city, is felt in
                    every corner.

                    Agora is not just a place, it is the soul of Athens; This is a place where citizens come together,
                    thought and commerce flourish, and freedom breathes.</p>

                <p class="gallery-text">Miletos is the pride of Ionia, an admirable expression of intelligence and
                    order! The plan of our city is a combination of Gods grace and human wisdom. This plan, shaped by
                    the hands of Hippodamos, proves to everyone that order is superior to chaos.

                    The city was built in a perfect grid pattern. Every street, every square was designed according to a
                    certain size and order. Instead of narrow and complex roads, we have wide avenues and streets that
                    intersect each other at right angles. Thanks to this system, our people find their way easily, and
                    our merchants transport their goods quickly.

                    The center of Miletos, its agora, is the heart of trade and exchange of ideas. Everything is in its
                    place here. Our temples rise with splendor worthy of our gods; Our sacred areas, erected in honor of
                    Poseidon, guide our sailors.

                    Miletos is not just a city, it is a living example of order and harmony. This plan is proof that
                    humans can challenge nature and that mind and art can work together in harmony.</p>
